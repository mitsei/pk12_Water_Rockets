# pk12_Water_Rockets
The Rockets module is a hands-on activity where students build and test a rockets made out of soda bottles. By exploring the process of iterative design, students will get multiple chances to design and redesign their rocket to accomplish various exciting challenges. Challenges are designed to explore concepts such as Newton’s 3rd law, air resistance, and the trade-off between velocity and acceleration. By the end of the activity, the students involved will understand the importance of the iterative process of design, the importance of ‘fail fast’, and the cool and fun outcomes you get when you keep improving on a design.
